#### A way to provide default HTML to the client

This is the package (intended to be) used to render via SSR templates on the meteor server-side to render (at least a subset of) templates relevant to the application, to pre-initialise the client-side with HTML.

Forked from [inject-data](https://github.com/meteorhacks/inject-data)

## Installation

meteor add bobbigmac:inject-html

See the docs for inject-data (and fast-render)
